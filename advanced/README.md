# Advanced

Welcome, advanced web engineers! In this project, you'll dive into
building a custom application using **Next.js** – a powerful React
framework that offers features like server-side rendering (SSR),
static site generation (SSG), and the flexibility to build sophisticated
web apps with ease. Your task is to create your own Next.js app,
with complete freedom to choose the use case.

To push your skills further, consider exploring advanced topics like
**Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** for offline capabilities,
**Static Site Generation (SSG)** for blazing-fast performance,
or **dynamic API routes** for custom server-side logic. You’ll
have access to the official [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
to guide you. This is your opportunity to build something innovative while
deepening your understanding of one of the most versatile web development
frameworks out there.

To start with nextJS, you'll need:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code (or any other)
- Basic knowledge of React
- `npx create-next-app@latest` to create a new Next.js project

Happy coding!
